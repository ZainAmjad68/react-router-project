SPA or Single Page Applications need to handle the routing themselves as the Browser can't handle it for them. This repo is my introdcution to one of the most popular Routing Library for React.

I've taken their official tutorial and learned many concepts including:
- React Router Form
- createBrowserRouter
- Outlet
- Link
- Loader and useLoaderData
- Action
- redirect
- NavLink
- useNavigation
- useNavigate
- errorElement
- useSubmit
- useFetcher
- Optimistic UI

To see the notes i've made for this, check out:
